# How to run the App?

First things first, get into both Application and Json-Server folders and run NPM INSTALL in order to install all the necessary dependencies.
Once done you can do:

```
NPM START
```

Once done, enjoy the applicaiton. It's a complete CRUD twitch-like app for live streaming running on React,Redux, Lodash and Json Server. 


# Testing
Jest and Enzyme will be added soon to the production environment

# Where is this project going ? 
I'll be running it serverles using node on AWS or netlify pretty soon. Whether then? let the rythm be your guiding light...
